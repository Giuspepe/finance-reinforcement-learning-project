# Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG) Implementation

This project contains an implementation of the Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG) algorithm, an extension of the Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm designed for environments with partial observability.

[iRDPG Paper](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/files/Publications/Yang-Liu-AAAI2020.pdf) (Next step)

RDPG implementation based largely on [off-policy-continuous-control](https://github.com/zhihanyang2022/off-policy-continuous-control.git)

## Todo:
- Implement Recurrent replay buffer.
- Test agent in gym environment.
- Merge implementation into ElegantRL for FinRL compatibility.
